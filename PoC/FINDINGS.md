# PoC Findings - Briefly Bot

This document summarizes the findings from various Proof of Concept implementations for the Briefly Bot project.

## Overview

We've explored multiple approaches for collecting and processing news content, each with different strengths and trade-offs. The goal is to create a comprehensive news aggregation system that can feed into a Slack bot for daily AI news digests.

## 1. BeautifulSoup Web Crawling PoC

**Location**: `PoC/beautifulsoup_poc/`

### What We Built

- **Generalized news crawler** that can handle multiple configurable sources
- **YAML-based configuration** for easy source management
- **Flexible CSS selector system** for different website structures
- **Deduplication** using content hashing and title normalization
- **Structured output** with JSON summaries

### Key Features

- `NewsSource` class for defining crawlable sources
- `load_sources_from_config()` for YAML configuration
- `extract_news_from_source()` with configurable selectors
- Rate limiting and respectful crawling
- Daily summary generation with source categorization

### Strengths

- ✅ **Simple and reliable** - BeautifulSoup is well-established
- ✅ **Easy to configure** - YAML files for non-technical users
- ✅ **Flexible selectors** - Can adapt to different site structures
- ✅ **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies

### Limitations

- ❌ **Static parsing** - Doesn't handle JavaScript-heavy sites
- ❌ **Site-specific** - Each source needs custom selectors
- ❌ **Maintenance overhead** - Selectors break when sites change
- ❌ **No built-in scheduling** - Manual execution required

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "total_articles": 25,
  "sources_summary": {
    "TechCrunch AI": 8,
    "VentureBeat AI": 7,
    "arXiv AI Papers": 10
  },
  "articles": [...]
}
```

## 2. RSS Feed Aggregation PoC

**Location**: `PoC/rss_poc/`

### What We Built

- **RSS feed aggregator** using the `feedparser` library
- **Intelligent caching** with update interval management
- **Content deduplication** across multiple feeds
- **Structured data extraction** from RSS XML

### Key Features

- `RSSSource` class for feed configuration
- `RSSNewsAggregator` with caching and deduplication
- Update interval checking to avoid unnecessary requests
- Content hash generation for duplicate detection

### Strengths

- ✅ **Standardized format** - RSS is a web standard
- ✅ **Efficient** - Only fetches when feeds update
- ✅ **Reliable** - RSS feeds are designed for this purpose
- ✅ **Low maintenance** - Feeds rarely change structure

### Limitations

- ❌ **Limited content** - Often just summaries, not full articles
- ❌ **Not all sites have RSS** - Declining in popularity
- ❌ **Update frequency varies** - Some feeds update slowly
- ❌ **Content quality varies** - Depends on source implementation

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "total_articles": 30,
  "feeds_processed": 6,
  "articles": [...]
}
```

- **Robots.txt compliance** and rate limiting

### Key Features

- `TechCrunchSpider`, `VentureBeatSpider`, `MITTechReviewSpider`
- `NewsPipeline` for item processing and deduplication
- `ScrapyNewsCrawler` for managing the crawling process

- ✅ **Robust error handling** - Built-in retry mechanisms

### Limitations

- ❌ **Complexity** - Steeper learning curve than BeautifulSoup
- ❌ **Overkill for simple sites** - Better for large-scale crawling
- ❌ **Resource intensive** - More memory and CPU usage
- ❌ **Configuration overhead** - More setup required

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "total_articles": 28,
  "spiders_executed": 3,
  "articles": [...]
}
```

- `APINewsCollector` for managing multiple APIs
- Deduplication across different API sources
- Fallback mechanisms for API failures

### APIs Integrated

#### ArXiv API

- **Purpose**: Academic research papers
- **Content**: Full paper metadata and abstracts
- **Rate Limits**: 1 request per 3 seconds
- **Authentication**: None required

#### NewsAPI.org

- **Purpose**: General news articles
- **Content**: Headlines, summaries, and metadata
- **Rate Limits**: 100 requests per day (free tier)
- **Authentication**: API key required

#### Papers with Code

- **Purpose**: ML research papers with code
- **Content**: Paper metadata and GitHub links
- **Rate Limits**: None specified
- **Authentication**: None required

### Strengths

- ✅ **Structured data** - APIs provide clean, consistent format
- ✅ **Reliable** - Official APIs are stable

- ✅ **No parsing needed** - Data comes pre-formatted

### Limitations

- ❌ **API limits** - Rate limiting and quotas
- ❌ **Cost** - Some APIs require paid plans

- ❌ **Limited sources** - Only sites with APIs

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "total_articles": 45,
  "sources_by_type": {
    "arxiv": 15,
    "newsapi": 20,

| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| BeautifulSoup | Medium          | High        | Low         | Medium      | Slow      |
| RSS           | High            | Low         | Medium      | High        | Fast      |
| Scrapy        | High            | Medium      | High        | High        | Very Fast |
| APIs          | Very High       | Low         | High        | Very High   | Fast      |
| Explorer      | Variable        | Low         | Medium      | Medium      | Medium    |

## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Primary**: RSS feeds for reliable, low-maintenance news
2. **Secondary**: API integration for high-quality, structured content
3. **Tertiary**: Scrapy for sites without RSS/APIs
4. **Exploratory**: News Explorer for trending topic discovery

### Integration Strategy

- Use RSS as the backbone for daily news collection
- Supplement with APIs for premium content sources
- Use Scrapy for custom crawling of important sites
- Use Explorer for trend detection and content discovery

### Next Steps

1. **Unify data models** across all PoCs
2. **Implement scheduling** for automated collection
3. **Add content summarization** using LLMs
4. **Create the Slack bot** that consumes all these sources
5. **Implement deduplication** across all collection methods

## Technical Debt & Issues

### Resolved

- ✅ Poetry dependency conflicts (pydantic versions)
- ✅ Scrapy pipeline item collection issues
- ✅ API parameter mismatches (ArXiv, Papers with Code)
- ✅ Environment variable loading
- ✅ DuckDuckGo selector updates

### Current

- ⚠️ Papers with Code temporarily removed due to dependency conflicts
- ⚠️ Some API rate limits may need monitoring
- ⚠️ Content extraction fallbacks could be improved

### Future Considerations

- 🔮 Implement proper caching layer
- 🔮 Add monitoring and alerting
- 🔮 Consider content quality scoring
- 🔮 Implement A/B testing for different collection methods
