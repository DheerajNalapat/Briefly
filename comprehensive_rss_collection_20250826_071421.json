      "summary": "Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging\npretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent\noutputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare\nconcepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose\nMV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images\nfrom a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion\nmodel on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.\nTraining such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid\nstrategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.\nThis involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views\nthat simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside\ntraining on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out\nview prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other\nviews to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD\nevaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.\nExperiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and\npersonalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D\nconsistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while\nmaintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.",

      "summary": "Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user\npreference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through\nrate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize\nDT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT\npredictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate\ndurations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to\nover-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address\nit with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts\nCTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further\nintroduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a\ntask-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated\neffect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to\ndeploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming\nCTR.

Existing work compares\nSAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a\nfree parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect\nof L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE\nfails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE\nwill mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the\nSAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate\na method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training\ndistribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak\nsparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have\nan L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct\nfeatures, practitioners must set L0 correctly.",
